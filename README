I.    Description
==================================================
I first used Alexandria (http://alexandria.rubyforge.org/)
for manage my book collection. Then I used a
spreadsheet and a Java program to generate  a HTML
file. This work quiet well for some time but it's
no way to manage 1000 or more books. So I began
this project.
Basically it's a webfrontend with a database to
store the book information.

II.   Requirements
==================================================
You need an Java Version 1.7.0_03 or later, an
Apache Tomcat 7.0.14.0 or later. To compile you
need Maven 2. Also you need a database. Currently
Hibernate is set up with a PostgreSQL 9.1. To set
it up use the commands from SQLCommands-file.

III.  Compiling Library
==================================================
To compile run: mvn compile

IV.   Start Library
==================================================
I included a Tomcat Server within the pom file, so
that you can run it with: mvn tomcat7:run.

V.    Troubleshooting
